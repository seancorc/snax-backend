App Name: Snax
Link to IOS repo: https://github.com/jsb459/snax
Backend Requirements: The backend for this app creates an API using Flask and
    SQLAlchemy that allows the frontend to access information about users, restaurants,
    food items and orders. It also provides routes to add items to a user's order, and
    place an order, and for other users to accept the order. The API Spec can be found at:         https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Snax-API-Spec--AclHUeVgtvVnGUFMW2oQRUYxAg-goH2fNqfeJDNLO0NRotNT.
